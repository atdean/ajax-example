# Simple AJAX Example

This is a simple demonstration of client/server interfacing. Using a PHP script on the server side, we query a local MySQL database and return a JSON response to the requesting client. The Javascript code included into the index page here requests this data and then displays it in a table on the page.

This is extremely basic and was written to accompany a job application. It forgoes a lot of error checking and OOP boilerplate for the sake of brevity.
